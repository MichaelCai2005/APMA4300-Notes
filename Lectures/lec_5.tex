\section{Linear Iterative Schemes for Linear Systems}
\begin{definition}
    Define the error at step \(k\)  to be 
    \[
        e^k = x^k -x \implies e^{k+1} = Be^k
    \]
    \[
        \implies e^k = B^k e^0
    \]
    We see if \(B\) is greater than \(1\) , we are amplifying the noise of the answer. Thus, we want to use some method 
    to get the size of the matrix \(I-A\) to be less than \(1\) 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Jacobi Iteration}
For the Jacobi Iteration we acn write that 
\[
    A= P-N
\]
\[
    Ax=y \implies Px = Nx +y 
\]
\begin{remark}
    We have rewritten the equation in this form but is not in the form \(x= Bx +y\). We can write instead 
    \[
        X = P^{-1} N x + P^{-1} y
    \]
    We can now perform the iteration here which makes the calculations much easier. 
\end{remark}
Recall that the Jacobi is going to consist of 
\[
    P= D_A, N = L_A + U_A
\]
\begin{remark}
    Selecting \(P = D_A\) is useful because the inverse of \(P \) is simply 
    \[
        \begin{pmatrix}
            \frac{1}{p_1} &  &   \\
             &  \frac{1}{p_2}&   \\
             &  &   \frac{1}{p_n}\\
        \end{pmatrix}
    \]
    Thus given \(x_0\),
    \[
        x^{k+1} = D^{-1}_A (L_A + U_A) x^k + D^{-1}_A y, k \geq 0   
    \]
    Note that if we have the diagonal to be 0 for one part, the method is not possible. However, it is nice 
    to see when the diagonal is very large. 
\end{remark}
In component form, we can write this as 
\[
    x_1^{k+1} = \frac{y_1 - \sum_{j \neq  1 }a_j x_j^K }{a_{11} }
\]
\[
    \vdots  
\]
\[
    x_i^{k+1} = \frac{y_i - \sum_{i \neq j} a_{ij} x_j^k }{a_{ii} } 
\]
\[
    \vdots
\]
\[
    x_n^{k+1} = \frac{y_n - \sum_{j \neq  n} a_{nj} x_j^k }{a_{nn} }
\]
\paragraph{Stopping Criteria}
We have to designate a stopping criteria for linear iterations. ONe of the methods is using a maximum amount of iterations 
and the other method is using the relative size of the residual. This is defined as the size of \(y - A x^k\) over the initial as 
\[
    \frac{\lVert y- Ax^k \rVert _{l2} }{\lVert y-Ax^0 \rVert _{l2}}
\]
