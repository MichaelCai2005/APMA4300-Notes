We now assume that the nodes are not given and we would like to pick nodes and weights 
\(\left\{ w_i, x_i \right\} \) s.t. it minimizes the error where 
\[
    \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathrm{d}x  \approx  \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i f(x_i)  
\]
The criteria we must determine are the \(2n\) parameters where the quadrature has a 
degree of accuracy \( K=  2n -1 \) where the polynomials are no greater than \(2n-1\)

\begin{eg}
Consider the integral
\[
    \int_{-1}^{1} f(x) \mathrm{d}x  = w_1 f(x_1) + w_2 f(x_2)   
\]
where we have \(2n- 1 =3\). Looking for polynomial of degree \(k=0\) we have
\(f(x) = 1 \implies  \int f = 2\) which requires 
\[
    w_1 f(x_1) + w_2 f(x_2) =2 \implies w_1 + w_2 =2 
\]
Next we do this requirement for \(k=1\)  , \(k=2 \), \(k=3\) . Solving 
we get a system of equations s.t. 
\[
    x_1 = \frac{-\sqrt{3} }{3}, x_2 = \frac{\sqrt{3} }{3}, w_1 =1 , w_2 =2 
\]
\end{eg}
